PyChain Ledger System with Streamlit Interface
Introduction
Welcome to the "PyChain Ledger System with Streamlit Interface" project. In this challenge, you'll take on the role of a fintech engineer at one of the world's largest banks. Your mission is to lead the development of a blockchain-based ledger system with an intuitive web interface. This ledger system will empower partner banks to perform financial transactions securely and verify the integrity of ledger data.

The Challenge
As the lead developer of the decentralized finance team, your tasks include:

Creating a Record Class: Develop a new data class named Record, which will define the structure of financial transaction records stored in the ledger.

Enhancing the Block Class: Update the existing Block data class by replacing the generic data attribute with a record attribute of type Record. This change will enable the ledger to store detailed financial transaction information.

Streamlit Application: Build a user-friendly web interface using Streamlit to collect and display relevant information for each financial transaction record. This interface will facilitate user interaction with the PyChain ledger.

Testing: Thoroughly test the complete PyChain ledger system to ensure its functionality and reliability.

Project Objectives
Your primary objectives in this project are to:

Create a structured data class (Record) for financial transaction records.
Modify the Block data class to store financial records.
Develop a Streamlit application that captures transaction details from users.
Verify the functionality of the PyChain ledger system.
Project Tasks
To accomplish these objectives, you will work on the following tasks:

Record Data Class: Define the structure of the Record data class to store financial transaction details.

Block Data Class Enhancement: Modify the existing Block data class to replace the data attribute with the record attribute.

Streamlit Application: Build a user-friendly web interface using Streamlit to collect information for each financial transaction, including sender, receiver, amount, and more.

Integration: Ensure seamless integration between the Streamlit application and the PyChain ledger.

Testing: Rigorously test the entire PyChain ledger system to validate its functionality.

Documentation: Update the README.md file in your GitHub repository to provide an explanation of the Streamlit application, showcase a screenshot or video of the deployed interface, and include any necessary instructions for users to interact with your project.

Conclusion
This project offers you an exciting opportunity to lead the development of a blockchain-based ledger system with a user-friendly Streamlit interface. By creating an efficient and secure platform for financial transactions, you will contribute to the success of your bank's decentralized finance team and provide partner banks with a powerful tool for conducting transactions and verifying data integrity.
